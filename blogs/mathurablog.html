        <h3> Nidhivan Temple</h3>
        <p>This temple is one of the most religious temples in Mathura. The locals, tourists, and visitors have a belief that the spirit of Lord Krishna resides in it. In the evening, the gates of the temple are closed because of a saying that Lord
          Krishna performs Rasleela with his gopis. No one is allowed to visit the temple after the gates are shut, and if one does, the person may turn, blind, deaf, and dumb. The temple is surrounded by trees and forests that provide a majestic
          view of the temple.
