        <h3>AUGARNATH TEMPLE</h3>
        <p>The Kali Paltan Mandir at Meerut is also known as the Baba Augarnath Mandir. The temple has great significance as the first war of Indian independence, the Revolt of 1857, started here. It is believed that there is a self-manifested Shivalingam in the temple. The temple has a memorial, built in honour of the martyrs of the Revolt of 1857.

<br>No one knows exactly when this temple was built. It is said the ‘Shiva linga’ present in this temple emerged on its own – a miracle that has been attracting the followers of Lord Shiva ever since its inception. According to local priests, the great Maratha rulers used to worship here and seek blessings before proceeding with their victory processions.
