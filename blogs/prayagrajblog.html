        <h3>Lalita Devi Temple</h3>
        <p>I visited this temple on the last day of Kumbh Visit. As per Google maps, it was just a few kilometers away from Sangam, but no auto was willing to take me there. Everyone was willing to take me some distance from where I can take another
          auto. I changed 5 autos or e-rickshaws to reach Lalita Devi Temple. The temple as you see now is fairly new with some signs of antiquity.
          <br> The image of Sri Lalita Devi is accompanied by two other images. Covered in silver all around, it looked very similar to the DevKali image I had seen in Ayodhya. It could be a regional influence. On a side niche, there were a series of
          Sri Yantra kept.
          <br>I sat down and chanted Lalita Sahasranama, spoke to the priest and a fellow devotee. We all sought her blessings for ourselves, our families and our society.

        <h3>Nag Vasuki Temple</h3>
        <p>If you are at Kumbh Mela, you probably know the story of Sagar Manthan or the churning of the oceans. The rope in this churning was a snake named Vasuki. His temple stands close to Ganga, overlooking Ganga in fact. The recent street art on
          its walls and steps makes it look inviting.

          <br>Inside there is a small temple in a typical medieval style with a simple Shikhara. In the northeast corner of this temple is a small temple dedicated to Asi Madhav – one of the 12 Madhavs in Prayagraj. I could not see the image behind
          the lattice in this temple as there were too many dogs here.
          <br>I spent some time and moved on to my next destination in Kumbh Mela. Being on height, this temple gives a great view of the Ganga and its banks. During Kumbh, you can see the tents all around.

        <h3>Bade Hanuman Ji or Lete Hanuman Ji Temple</h3>
        <p>This ancient temple is located close to Triveni Sangam. It is a part of Allahabad Fort built by Akbar, but it is accessible to the public. It is usually very crowded on Tuesdays, but during Kumbh Mela, every day was like a Tuesday. So, I
          stood in the queue to enter the temple. Slow queues let you observe the place in detail. I saw the temple compound all soaked on Kesari color – the color of Hanuman. A shop selling Rudraksha Mala, a wall mural and an ancient Banyan tree
          were all surrounded by people.
          <br>The temple steps took us down a few steps and there was this giant statue of Hanuman Ji in a lying down posture. No wonder he is called ‘Lete Hanuman Ji’. It is called ‘Bade Hanuman Ji’ for its big size and Qila Hanuman Ji for it is a
          part of fort premises. The original image seems to be in black granite. But the Sindoor all over the body makes it look Sindoori.
