        <h3>Kashi Vishwanath Mandir</h3>
        <p>If Varanasi is the Spiritual Capital of the country, then Kashi Vishwanath Temple is its crowning glory. Situated on the western banks of the River Ganga, it is one of the twelve holiest jyotirlingas or sacred centers of Shiva worship
          spread across India. This ancient Varanasi Shiva temple finds mention in the Puranas. The main deity of the shrine is a linga that is placed upon a silver altar. What is truly fascinating about this temple is that it has been subjected to
          destruction and re-construction a number of times over the course of history. But the temple has never bowed to the dictates of time and even today, it stands as one of the most popular temples in Varanasi that is thronged by devotees and
          tourists in thousands, every day.
          Another interesting fact about this temple is that it features a gold dome and a gold spire on top. It is believed that if you make a wish after seeing the dome, Lord Shiva fulfills your wish. Legend has it that when the Mughal ruler
          Aurangzeb planned to destroy the temple, the idol of the temple deity was hidden in a well inside the temple complex. The well is still there. Be sure to take a look at this historical well when you visit the temple.

        <h3>Maa Annapurna Mandir</h3>
        <p>Your trip to Varanasi can’t be deemed complete without paying a visit to the famous Annapurna Temple. Annapurna Devi is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. In this temple, she is worshipped as the benevolent provider of
          food and nourishment. It was Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao who, in 1729 AD, constructed this picturesque temple that depicts the Nagara style of architecture. It is a common practice by devotees to donate grains and food at this temple and pray
          for life-long prosperity.     
          The temple features two idols of the goddess. One of these idols is made of gold while the other one is made of brass. You can see the brass idol on any day of the year, but to see the gold idol you will have to plan your visit on the day
          before Diwali, which is popularly known as Annakut day. On this day, devotees and visitors are allowed to have a look at the gold idol each year.</p>

        <h3>Durga Kund Mandir</h3>
        <p>Built in honor of Goddess Durga, the Durga Kund Temple stands next to a rectangular pond (kund) and hence the name. Also known as Durga Temple or the Monkey Temple, this shrine is a fine example of the Nagara style of architecture that
          is popular in North India. The red stone temple features a multi-tiered spire. The temple was constructed in the 18th century by a Bengali queen and since then, it has assumed a prominent place in the hearts and minds of devotees from
          across the country.  
          Like most Varanasi temples and ghats, the Durga Kund temple also has an interesting story related to it. As per the legends, the existing icon of the goddess isn’t a man-made structure. It appeared on its own in the temple complex. If
          you are intrigued enough, do make it a point to visit this temple during your Varanasi trip.
